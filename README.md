# Hey there! 👋 

I'm Sebastian, an **aspiring web developer** based in Poland.

I love building small projects, experimenting with code, and improving my skills every day.

My main tech stack is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and MySQL. My favourite tools are Visual Studio Code, Apple Notes and enjoy sketching website ideas on my iPad.

Here are some of my pinned projects 👇
